One form of community archiving is a History Harvest, which ask community members if they have something--an object, a memory, a place, a story--that reflects their history. Over the course of the last several years, members of the Indiana University Bloomington community have been helping folks preserve those objects in digital form, offering the chance for contributors to add an oral history of the object alongside its digital version. The Institute for Digital Arts & Humanities and the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society, and undergraduate and graduate students from the Department of History have worked with communities on the IUB campus and communities in Indiana and Ohio to preserve history that would otherwise not make it into museums.
